- 👋 Hi, I’m Mike Allison (@mjallison42)
- 👀 I’ve been coding since the mid 70's and really enjoy it as a career and hobby. 
- 🌱 I like to learn one new language each year, enough to dabble in. I'm now looking for the post covid language to learn.
- 💞️ I am currently collaborating on the Commander X16 retro project.
- 📫 How to reach me: email GitHub id + gmail.
